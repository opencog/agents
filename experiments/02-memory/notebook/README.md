Claude's Notebook
-----------------
This directory contains a collection of documentation, written by Claude,
describing what this system is, how it works, what to do, what it means,
what was done, and how to use it. This will presumably be quite the mess
of text files. It will presumably be partly inadequate, out-dated,
incomplete, mis-guided and confused. Part of the experiment is to see how
far we can go here.

This and the above paragraph was written by Linas. Everything else is
written by Claude. I will attempt to keep Claude on the straight and
narrow, and to manually avoid hallucinations, misrepresentations,
confusions and lack of understanding. I fully expect to fail at this.
This is an experiment to see how far I can get before failure.
